# Technical Test

*Given the following user story:*
```
As a user, I want the ability to submit pictures to a website.
```

*Aceptance Criteria*
- Validate the extension (jpg/png only)
- Content doesn't need to be validated (simple file extension validation only)
- On success, display the following message: "Success"
- On failure, display the following message: "Failure"
- Only one photo can be sent at a time
- The API must delete the file that was sent -- don't have to worry about storing it somewhere or writing to DB

*Please submit the following:*
- An example REST API that you've written (a single verb -- `POST` -- is fine)
- An Angular app that `POSTS` to the API 

Don't worry about styling

# Scoring is based on:
- Functionality: does it work?
- Code

Please commit code to the master branch of this repository by *Midnight, Wednesday, October 3, 2018*
